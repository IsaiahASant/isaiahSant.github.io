      <p class="section-title">Artistic Inspirations</p>

      <p>
        It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:
      </p>

      <p><strong>Impressionism</strong><br>
      Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract Expressionism</strong><br>
      This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.</p>

      <p><strong>Pop Art</strong><br>
      A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.</p>

      <p>
