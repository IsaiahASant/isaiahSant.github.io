                Upon Reseraching AI, I was told to look into this called OpenClaw. 
                OpenClaw is an open source LLM that you can locally host on your personal computer.
                It's main purpose is to serve you as your personal little assisstant that can not just 
                only giving your answers to prompt but can actually run commands and task directly on 
                your computer. OpenClaw is really cool but becareful with downloading it because giving 
                root access of your computer to one single LLM can be a security nightmare.

                To continue off of my last blog, I made a better example, of what the
                letter is supposed to look like. What I've learned from this project that
                LLM can do many things especially in a timely manner. However, they lack of 
                creativity and does not see the sames things as humans do. In other words, AI won't replace 
                humans.....yet?

            LLMS are biggest break through in computer science! However how good are 
            LLm's actually are. In my Web development Lab, we tried giving an Ai agent
            a PDF file letter that they need to remake with CSS and HTML. As you click on
            the link it is okay
